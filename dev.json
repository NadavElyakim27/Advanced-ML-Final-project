Panama is used as the clean business front. You also can't ignore the *positive* involvement of the US in Panama (overseeing the canal); we have an obvious economic interest in Panama *not* being a terrifying place because it would shit all over our trade, whereas the security of Mexico or Colombia is less of a concern for us. \n\n\nFirst, the way we profited by drug countries was *through* the creation and sale of drugs. Then, when those drugs are sold in the US, we profit by criminalizing them and filling the prisons with cheap labor, with the secondary \"benefit\" of disproportionately targetting people of color and other undesirables; a fine bonus for the racists in charge of policy. Fear of violence increases the production and sale of arms, both small (for the protection of the average citizen) and military-grade (in case we need another intervention). We can also sell weapons to those countries now facing the drug violence we basically bankrolled, leading to more profit. That fear also drives citizens here to vote for the political party viewed as \"tougher\" on crime, which does not create any incentive for said party to *actually* help solve the problem so long as they can keep up appearances alone.

It\u2019s never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing.\n\n&gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*.\n\n&gt;No, for some reason, those that screech #NotAllImmigrants! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements.\n\n&gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it.\n\n&gt;Here\u2019s how it usually goes:\n\n&gt;Local: I\u2019ve been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab.\n\n&gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think it\u2019s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldn\u2019t. Isn\u2019t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush?\n\n&gt;Well, actually\u2026\n\n&gt; The #NotAllImmigrants brigade don\u2019t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we\u2019ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way.\n\n&gt;That would be, well, a bit silly.\n\n&gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why \u2018\u2019immigrants\u2019\u2019 continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldn\u2019t be controversial.\n\n&gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and you\u2019ve reminded us enough, thanks.\n\n&gt; So #NotAllImmigrants doesn\u2019t clarify anything. It doesn\u2019t add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived experiences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that \u2018\u2019not all immigrants are like that\u2019\u2019, are actually saying is, \u2018\u2019I\u2019m not like that.\u2019\u2019 Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and they\u2019d like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue.\n\n&gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on #MeToo. To ask us to hand out cookies and \u2018Well Done For Not Raping Anybody\u2019 badges to immigrants who rush to tell us #NotAllImmigrants, is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst.\n\n&gt; If you are an immigrant and don\u2019t recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great.

[EOS]\nReally ? [EOS]\nOK : thought experiment : & gt;Not all Immigrants . [EOS]\n& gt;It \u2019s the phrase we hear time and time again , albeit in a very narrow set of circumstances . [EOS]\nIt \u2019s never used , for example , when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals , or immigrants are great at dancing . [EOS]\n& gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here * . [EOS]\n& gt;No , for some reason , those that screech # NotAllImmigrants ! [EOS]\nnever seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements . [EOS]\n& gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment , as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light , you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it . [EOS]\n& [EOS]\ngt;Here \u2019s how it usually goes : & gt;Local : I \u2019ve been shouted at in the street , groped in nightclubs , assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab . [EOS]\n& [EOS]\ngt;Immigrant : [EOS]\nActually , I think it \u2019s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this . [EOS]\nMost immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way . [EOS]\nI certainly would n\u2019t . [EOS]\nIs n\u2019t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush ? [EOS]\n& gt;Well , actually \u2026 & gt ; The # NotAllImmigrants brigade do n\u2019t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we \u2019ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way . [EOS]\n& gt;That would be , well , a bit silly . [EOS]\n& gt ; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life , then us asking why \u2018 \u2019 immigrants \u2019\u2019 continue to perpetuate this culture , should n\u2019t be controversial . [EOS]\n& [EOS]\ngt ; Yes , we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible . [EOS]\nYes , we KNOW that you would never do that ; and you \u2019ve reminded us enough , thanks . [EOS]\n& gt ; So # NotAllImmigrants does n\u2019t clarify anything . [EOS]\nIt does n\u2019t add to the discussion or develop it in any way .
