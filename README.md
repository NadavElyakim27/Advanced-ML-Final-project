# Introduction:
**BUT-FIT at SemEval-2019 Task 7: Determining the Rumour Stance with Pre-Trained Deep Bidirectional Transformers**
Fighting false rumors on the internet is a tedious task. Interest in automated verification of rumors has deepened, as research
has demonstrated the potential impact of false claims on important political outcomes.
Rumour verification is characterized by the need to consider evolving conversations and
news updates to reach a verdict on a rumor’s veracity. The paper we chose tries to better
classify those Rumours. More precisely, it takes part in a competition called ”SemEval
2019 Task 7: RumourEval 2019: **Determining Rumour** Veracity and Support for Rumours,
Subtask A”. This competition focused on classifying whether posts from Twitter and Reddit
**support, deny, query, or comment** on a hidden rumor, the truthfulness of which is the
topic of an underlying discussion thread. This paper used the **most recent BERT architecture**
(as of 2019) along with ensembling methods to build an end-to-end system. Their
system has reached the F1 score of 56.7% on the provided test data (61.67% by using
Ensembling). They finished in 2nd place in the competition. We reviewed related works
done in the field and also go over the implementation of the chosen paper. Then we reconstruct
the system and reached the **F1 score of 57.56%** even slightly above the anchor
paper.
